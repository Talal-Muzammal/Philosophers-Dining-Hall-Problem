# Dining Philosophers Problem in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Dining Philosophers problem. The Dining Philosophers problem is a classic synchronization and concurrency problem that explores challenges in resource sharing among multiple processes or threads.

## Problem Description

- There are five philosophers sitting around a dining table.
- Each philosopher thinks and eats spaghetti.
- To eat, a philosopher must have two forks (one on the left and one on the right).
- There is a single fork between each pair of adjacent philosophers.
- Philosophers must pick up both forks to eat and put them down when they're done.

## Implementation

The Python implementation in this repository uses threading and synchronization techniques to solve the Dining Philosophers problem. It includes a solution that avoids deadlock and starvation.
